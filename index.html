                    The C programming language by Dennis M Ritchie and Brian W Keringhan is an excellent book for both new comers and expert programmers. The book is packed with many examples and is yet small and concise. This book is written by the person that created the language, so there is no better source of information. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to become a really good programmer... <a  href ='C-Programming-Language.html'>Read more</a>
